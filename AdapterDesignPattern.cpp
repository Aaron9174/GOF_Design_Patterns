/**
 * The adapter design pattern describes how to solve such problems:
 * - Define a separate adapter class that converts the (incompatible) interface of a class (adaptee) into another interface (target) clients require.
 * - Work through an adapter to work with (reuse) classes that do not have the required interface.
